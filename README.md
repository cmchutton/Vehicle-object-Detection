# Vehicle-Object-Detection
This is a simple Arduino project with cheap parts total cost is $35.00. This has a limited range of about 115 inches at slow speed.  The ultrasonic distance sensor sends out a pulse and listens for the return pulse similar to radar. The program then calculates the distance based on the length of time between the send pulse and return pulse.  After the distance is calculated it displays the distance on the lcd. Because of the limited range and slow refresh rate this would be usefull for backing up into your garage or pulling up close to a wall; however, it is not suitable for on road applications, that would require a much better system such as lazar or millimeter wavelength radar  
The code is very basic right now but there is alot I would like to try with it as I am still learning.

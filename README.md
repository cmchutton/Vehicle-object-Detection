# Vehicle-object-Detection
simple arduino project with cheap parts. This has a range of about 115 inches but for 35 dollars what do you expect. now upgrade the ultrasonic rangefinder and everthing else would still work and your could spend a little over 100 dollars each sensor and and your range would increase to 115 feet and would be water proof so safe to leave mounted in or under your front bumper 
still have a lot of code to write to clean it up and display the way i want it too.

  Ping))) Sensor

  This sketch reads a PING))) ultrasonic
  rangefinder and returns the distance to the
  closest object in range. To do this, it sends a
  pulse to the sensor to initiate a reading, then
  listens for a pulse to return.  The length of
  the returning pulse is proportional to the
  distance of the object from the sensor.

  The circuit:
   * +V connection of the PING))) attached to +5V
   * GND connection attached to ground
   * SIG connection attached to digital pin 7

  LiquidCrystal Library - Hello World

 Demonstrates the use a 16x2 LCD display.  The LiquidCrystal
 library works with all LCD displays that are compatible with the
 Hitachi HD44780 driver. There are many of them out there, and you
 can usually tell them by the 16-pin interface.

 This sketch prints "Hello World!" to the LCD
 and shows the time.

  The circuit:
 * LCD RS pin to digital pin 12
 * LCD Enable pin to digital pin 11
 * LCD D4 pin to digital pin 5
 * LCD D5 pin to digital pin 4
 * LCD D6 pin to digital pin 3
 * LCD D7 pin to digital pin 2
 * LCD R/W pin to ground
 * LCD VSS pin to ground
 * LCD VCC pin to 5V
 * 10K resistor:
 * ends to +5V and ground
 * wiper to LCD VO pin (pin 3)
